                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/ourstorypic.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>We intend to make chilika lake plastic free by educating the youth about the adverse effects of plastic and how it can curb the balance of the natural ecosystem of the Chilika lake. We believe in creating awareness about the why's starting
                    right from the grassroot level, and further address the how's with the cooperation of the local community and the governing bodies.
                </p>

                <blockquote>It is rightly said that education is the most powerful weapon. Our main motive is to reduce plastic usage by educating and engaging with schools, colleges and the local communities and creating awareness to bring about the desired change.</blockquote>

                <h2>The Gambhari Village - Our First Milestone</h2>
                <p>“Gambhari”, our pilot project, is situated near Satapara &amp; Chilika lake. The panchayat Gambhari comprises of 4 villages and an approximate population of 6000 people.
                </p>

                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/gambop.png" alt="" /></span>Gambhari is panchayat in Puri district comprising of 4 villages and an approximate population of 6000 people. Majority of the villagers of Gambhari are dependent on
                    the aquatic resources of Chilika, particularly prawn and fish, for their survival. Prawn cultivation is the major source of income for the village. Besides prawn and crabs, “Khainga”, “dangala”, “vetki”, “khurenti” and “Shahala” are
                    a few of the daily catches of the fishermen community of this village. Living in such close proximity with the Chilika lake, Gambhari is a village which has witnessed the adverse effects of pollution on the lagoon at a very personal
                    level.
                </p>

                <br>

                <blockquote>“When I was kid, the lake was pure and clean, but now I see polythene bags floating everywhere”, says Kailash, a junior ranger from Gambhari.
                </blockquote>

                <br>
                <p>Due to many reasons like dumping of waste, irresponsible consumption of aquatic resources, spread of invasive species, loss of biodiversity, the Chilika lake is dying which would cause deadly affects on the lives of hundreds of villages
                    like gambhari. The question is, “How fast can we stop it?”
                </p>




                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/crabby.png" alt="" /></span>Chilika shelters various endangered and rare species of insects, birds and animals including the famous Irrawaddy Dolphins that can only be found in chilika and are
                    listed under IUCN as an endangered species. An extremely productive ecosystem and fishery ground, chilika provides as a source of income to more than 2 lakh local fishermen. Counted as a biodiversity hotspot in the world it was declared
                    a ‘Ramsar Site’ (a wetland of international importance) by UNESCO for its rich biodiversity since 1981 and is a major tourist attraction for thousands of birdwatchers and nature lovers every year.</p>


                <br>

                <h2>The Local Junior Rangers</h2>
                <p>We have created an enthusiastic team comprising of school kids from Gambhari called &quot;Chilika Junior Rangers&quot;.
                </p>

                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/polluted-chilika.jpg" alt="" /></span>The Chilika Junior Rangers will play a vital role in shaping the community. We aim to educate them about the adverse effects of plastic and further work with
                    them to reduce the usage of single use plastic and the safe disposal of waste. Each junior ranger takes over the responsibilty of his/her own house and surroundings and ensures that it is clean. We shall conduct regular cleanliness
                    drives, activities and meetings. This is a completely student driven project and the chilika junior rangers shall protect the very existence of the greatest brackish water lake, chilika, which is at its closest to eutrophication.</p>
